# Sound Trigger
by Leandro Estrella

This simple sound trigger listens to the noise level in your room, and sends an ON signal when it gets over a certain level. You can make that threshold louder or softer using the "trigger value" IOBox. I like to use it with a FileStream to start my video installations when somebody enters into the exhibition space.
